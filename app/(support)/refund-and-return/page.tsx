            <p>
              We offer a 7-day refund policy for purchases. Returned items must
              be received by us within 7 days of delivery, in new, unused
              condition, with all tags attached. Items that are damaged, soiled,
              or carry strong scents (such as perfumes) will not qualify for a
              refund.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once we receive the returned goods, they will be inspected, and
              the refund will be processed. Please allow 7-14 days for the
              refund to reflect in your account.
